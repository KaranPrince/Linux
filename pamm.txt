Objective:
Configure PAM to enforce password complexity rules, including length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Steps:
1. Install PAM Password Quality Module (If Needed)
Ensure the required PAM module (pam_pwquality.so) is installed:

sudo yum install pam_pwquality -y   # For RHEL/CentOS
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality -y  # For Ubuntu/Debian
2. Configure Password Complexity Rules
Edit the PAM password policy file:


sudo nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf
Set the following rules to enforce a strong password policy:


minlen = 12        # Minimum password length (12 characters)
dcredit = -1       # Require at least one digit
ucredit = -1       # Require at least one uppercase letter
lcredit = -1       # Require at least one lowercase letter
ocredit = -1       # Require at least one special character
retry = 3          # Allow 3 retries before failure
Save and exit the file.

3. Apply PAM Module in System Authentication
Modify the PAM password authentication file:


sudo nano /etc/pam.d/system-auth  # For RHEL/CentOS
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password  # For Ubuntu/Debian
Find the following line:


password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3
Ensure it matches the policy you set in pwquality.conf. If it's missing, add:


password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 enforce_for_root
The enforce_for_root option ensures that even the root user follows password policies.

4. Apply Password History Restriction
To prevent users from reusing old passwords, edit:


sudo nano /etc/security/opasswd
Then modify /etc/pam.d/system-auth or /etc/pam.d/common-password to add:

password sufficient pam_unix.so remember=5
This ensures users cannot reuse the last 5 passwords.

5. Test the Policy
Change the password for a user:

passwd <username>
Try setting a weak password (e.g., password123). It should be rejected.
Try setting a strong password (e.g., Str0ng@Passw0rd). It should be accepted.
6. Check Password Change Logs
To verify if password changes were enforced, check:


sudo tail -f /var/log/secure  # RHEL/CentOS
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log  # Ubuntu/Debian
Bonus: Add Account Lockout Policy
To lock a user after 3 failed login attempts, add the following to /etc/pam.d/system-auth:

auth required pam_tally2.so deny=3 unlock_time=600
deny=3 → Lock the account after 3 failed login attempts.
unlock_time=600 → Unlock the account automatically after 10 minutes.
Check failed attempts with:


pam_tally2 -u <username>
Summary
✅ Enforced strong password rules
✅ Prevented password reuse
✅ Implemented account lockout for security
