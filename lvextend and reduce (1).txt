Prerequisites

Backup your data: 
	Always ensure you have a backup of important data before resizing logical volumes.

Install LVM: 
	Ensure that the LVM (Logical Volume Manager) tools are installed on your system.

Check current space: 
	Use lvdisplay to view the current size and free space available in your volume group.


Step 1: Extending a Logical Volume (lvextend)
Check Available Space:

vgdisplay
Identify the Logical Volume:


lvdisplay
Extend the Logical Volume: You can extend the logical volume by a specific size or by using all available space in the volume group.


To add a specific size:

lvextend -L +SIZE /dev/VG_NAME/LV_NAME
Replace SIZE (e.g., 10G for 10 GB) with the desired amount.


To use all available space:

lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/VG_NAME/LV_NAME

Resize the Filesystem: After extending the logical volume, you need to resize the filesystem. The command depends on the filesystem type.
For ext4:

resize2fs /dev/VG_NAME/LV_NAME
For xfs:

xfs_growfs /mount/point

Step 2: Reducing a Logical Volume (lvreduce)
Unmount the Filesystem: If you’re reducing a logical volume, you must unmount the filesystem first.

umount /mount/point
Check and Resize the Filesystem: Before reducing the logical volume, you need to resize the filesystem to a size smaller than the logical volume you are planning to reduce.

For ext4:
resize2fs /dev/VG_NAME/LV_NAME NEW_SIZE
For xfs: You cannot reduce xfs filesystems directly, so you may need to back up data, recreate the filesystem, and restore the data.

Reduce the Logical Volume:

lvreduce -L NEW_SIZE /dev/VG_NAME/LV_NAME
Replace NEW_SIZE (e.g., 20G) with the desired size.

Resize the Filesystem Again: After reducing the logical volume, you may need to resize the filesystem again.
For ext4:

resize2fs /dev/VG_NAME/LV_NAME
Remount the Filesystem:

mount /dev/VG_NAME/LV_NAME /mount/point
Example Commands
Extend Logical Volume:

lvextend -L +10G /dev/myvg/mylv
resize2fs /dev/myvg/mylv
Reduce Logical Volume:


umount /mnt/mydata
resize2fs /dev/myvg/mylv 8G
lvreduce -L 8G /dev/myvg/mylv
resize2fs /dev/myvg/mylv
mount /dev/myvg/mylv /mnt/mydata
Notes
Always ensure you have backups before performing operations that modify disk structures.
Be cautious with lvreduce, as it can lead to data loss if the filesystem isn’t resized properly beforehand.
